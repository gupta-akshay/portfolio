* [Resend](https://resend.com) to send mails

> The project was deployed on Gatsby Cloud.
It has now been moved to Netlify after it acquired Gatsby. Read more [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/gatsby-cloud-evolution/).

## How to run locally

 * Create `.env.development` at the root of the project.
    * This will contain `RESEND_API_KEY` for your Resend account.
    * This key is used in `src/api/sendMail.ts`.
    * This function (Gatsby Feature) actions provide a simple way to build APIs for your project. https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/
 * You can install `gatsby-cli` globally. And run the project using `gatsby develop`.
